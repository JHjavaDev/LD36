#LD36 (Lyrics)
My entry for Ludum Dare 36.

Lyrics is a retro text adventure game.

It is about a journey through the recent history of music and music devices such as tapes and the CD. You will have to solve puzzles to move forward through time.

Lyrics was made completely from scratch in Java using IntelliJ IDEA.

How to play:
Type the action followed by one or more parameters, separated by spaces
<action> <p1> <p2> ...


The game needs Java to run: https://java.com/en/download/

There is a problem with saving in linux. If you are using linux run the game from a terminal to properly save and load the game. It should work in OS X and Windows.


Hint: The 'look' action is important
